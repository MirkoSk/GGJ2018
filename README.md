Neon Nova Ultra Space Rumble is the ultimate local 3 vs 1 laser arena brawler any sane soul has to play at least once. Itâ€™s as addicting as taking a nap when you actually have work to do and just canâ€™t stop procrastinating.

This game was developed during the Global Game Jam 2018 with a team of 4 persons at the Harz University of Applied Sciences. 
We had a blast developing this and the fast gameplay and music definitely helped to keep us awake.ðŸ˜‰
